 * Project Name:   Counter Coin
 * Project Author: Taine Smith
 * GitHub Repo:    GITHUB REPO URL HERE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Notes: This is a two-player game, played on a one-dimensional grid with coins, where the aim is to win by being the player who removes the gold coin.
 * PROJECT NOTES HERE
 * Start by asking for each players names (this for the end screen). Each player will be "Player 1" & or "Player 2", however it should show who is what "Player" by their inputted name
 * Make the coins, and assign them different values (Silver coin - silverCoin1) as there will be multiple coins.
